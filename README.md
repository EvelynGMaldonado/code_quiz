<h2 id="description"> Project Description </h2>
A web API is an application programming interface for either a web server or a web browser and it is usually limited to a web application's client-side. A server-side web API is a programmatic interface consisting of one or more publicly exposed endpoints to a defined requestâ€“response message system, typically expressed in JSON or XML.
Code Quiz application consists of multiple choice questions; it will be a timed quiz that run in the browser and it will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code and a responsive user interface.

## Installation 
Implementation of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Web API's.

## Usage 
Code Quiz Application is a timed quiz that stores high scores. When the user is taking the quiz, and they click the start button, then the timer starts and the first question is presented. When the user answers the first question, then the next question is presented. After the user answers a question incorrectly, then time is substracted from the clock. When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches zero, then the game is over and the user can save their initials as well as their score. After the game is over, the results are saved in local storage and displayed on the high scores results section.
